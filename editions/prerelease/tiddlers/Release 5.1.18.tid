!! Major Improvements

!!! Node.js HTTP Server

The HTTP WebServer functionality has been significantly improved:

* [[Adds ability|WebServer Authorization]] to make a wiki that is read-only for anonymous users (with the editing UI hidden), but allows editing for users who log in
* Adds support for [[serving static file attachments over HTTP|Using the integrated static file server]]
* Adds support for [[multiple user credentials for basic authentication|WebServer Parameter: credentials]] via a CSV file containing usernames/passwords, with more fine grained authorisation (ie granting/denying individual users read/write permission to resources)
* Hides UI features like the new tiddler button and the edit button when the user only has [[read-only access|WebServer Authorization]] to the wiki
* Adds support for [[serving over HTTPS|Using HTTPS]] as well as HTTP
* Adds support for authentication via a [[trusted header|WebServer Parameter: authenticated-user-header]], making it easier to integrate with corporate single sign on (and Windows authentication)
* Better [[debugging information|WebServer Parameter: debug-level]]
* Experimental support for a [[new, plain HTML single tiddler per page view|Using the read-only single tiddler view]]
* Adds a simple level of [[CSRF protection|WebServer Parameter: csrf-disable]]
* Deprecating the existing ServerCommand in favour of a new  Listenommand using the new NamedCommandParameters support for named parameters that can be specified in any order
* Refactoring routes as separate modules, making it easier to extend the server with new functionality

See WebServer for more details, or [[see the changes on GitHub|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/2679]].
